pytest can be used to write test cases and automatically test a program. Letâ€™s see how we can write test cases using pytest for the boarding requirement.

Note: Here we are assuming that the boarding requirement is implemented in a function named boarding which accepts the seat_number and returns the batch_no.

import pytest

def test_boarding_1():
  result=boarding(0)
  assert result==-1


Test functions should be written in a similar manner for the remaining test data as well.
